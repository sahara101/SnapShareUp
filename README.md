## Installation

1. Download the SnapShareUp.dmg file

2. Open the DMG file

3. Drag SnapShareUp to your Applications folder

4. Due to macOS security measures for apps from unidentified developers:

   - When first trying to open the app, you'll get a security warning

   - Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security

   - Scroll down to the Security section where you'll see a message about "SnapShareUp" being blocked

   - Click "Open Anyway"

   - Click "Open" in the final confirmation dialog

5. Follow the setup instructions in the app

Note: These security steps are only required the first time you open the app. Subsequent launches will open normally.
